# Social Anxiety Exposure Simulator

A Unity-based application that simulates graded social exposure scenarios in a controlled virtual environment.

## Overview

The project implements a three-level progression system where social intensity increases over time:

- **Level 1:** NPCs enter and sit at distant seats  
- **Level 2:** NPCs sit closer and increase gaze interaction  
- **Level 3:** An NPC approaches the player and initiates conversation  

## Technical Highlights

- Unity (C#)
- NavMesh-based AI navigation
- Dynamic seat allocation system
- Event-driven level controller
- Coroutine-based dialogue timing
